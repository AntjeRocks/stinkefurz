## Naming

<details>
<summary>Why this name?</summary>
This will be a very bad derivative of the former MB-Lab. I will remove some functions, which I do not need and this won't be a Blender Addon.
Additionally I won't be able in the future to work on this project. So it is just a smelly project, which I will use for one single use and never touch it again.

<summary>Am I allowed to call it 'Stinkefurz'?</summary>
me: Are there any restrictions why I shouldn't call my derivative of MB-Lab "Stinkefurz" ?

ChatGPT: From a legal and licensing perspective, there is no restriction in the AGPL-3.0 that would prevent you from naming your derivative project "Stinkefurz." You are free to choose any name for your project as long as you comply with the license terms, such as maintaining the same AGPL-3.0 license, providing proper attribution, and making the source code available.

However, there are a few practical considerations to keep in mind when naming your project:
1. Professionalism and Perception:

    The name of your project can impact how it is perceived by the community, potential users, and contributors. A name like "Stinkefurz" (which translates to "stinky fart" in English) might be viewed as humorous or whimsical, but it might also be seen as unprofessional depending on your target audience. Consider how the name aligns with the purpose and tone of your project.

2. Searchability and Branding:

    A name that is unique but also descriptive can help with branding and searchability. If you want your project to be taken seriously and easily found by users who might be interested in it, choosing a name that reflects its function or its improvements over the original project could be beneficial.

3. Trademark Considerations:

    While "Stinkefurz" is unlikely to be a trademarked term, it's always good to ensure that the name you choose doesn't infringe on any existing trademarks, especially if you plan to distribute or commercialize the project.

4. Community and Collaboration:

    If you plan to build a community around your project or attract contributors, the name might influence whether people are drawn to it. A humorous name could be appealing in certain contexts, but it might also limit your audience if it is perceived as too informal.


Conclusion:

Legally, you can name your project "Stinkefurz" without violating the AGPL-3.0 license, as long as you adhere to the license's other conditions. However, consider the broader implications of the name on the project's reception and success in the open-source community. If you're comfortable with these considerations, then there's no restriction preventing you from using that name.
